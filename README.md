The StudentSync Scheduler project is a web application built using various technologies such as NodeJS, MongoDB, ExpressJS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal of this project is to create a platform that facilitates and manages students' requests to return to campus after a period of absence.

By streamlining the process of handling campus return requests, the Student Returning Scheduler aims to enhance the efficiency and organization of managing student movements on campus. This could be particularly useful for educational institutions or organizations with specific return policies in place.
